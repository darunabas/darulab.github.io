  <p style="margin-right: 50px;"><p>I joined the Daru lab in the Fall of 2024. I received my Bachelor of Arts in Environmental Biology and Anthropology from Washington University in St. Louis in 2024. I have previously worked with Dr. Swanne Gordon studying the plasticity of color in Trinidadian Guppies, and at Tufts University studying the impacts of various land use techniques on plant quality and Bombus impatien pollination patterns. I am deeply passionate about learning why diversity exists in nature, and how we can use ecological research to inform conservation action plans. In the Daru Lab I hope to understand the mechanisms behind, and patterns of, plant diversity!
