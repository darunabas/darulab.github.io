<h1>Mission and Philosophy</h1>
  <p>The Daru Lab's mission is to contribute to the understanding and preservation of biodiversity through top-quality research, information, and training. We prioritize collaborations with partners in research, education, technology, and impact to support conservation stakeholders and the scientific community. Our goal is to produce accessible and impactful public products for the benefit of society.</p>
  <h2>Expectations for PhD Students</h2>
  <p>As a PhD student in the Daru Lab, your primary focus will be on original research. Familiarize yourself with the guidelines for courses, exams, teaching, and administrative tasks to ensure timely completion. We approach ecology with an open mind, humility, and a willingness to learn through trial and error. Our diverse team is committed to studying biodiversity in the realm of ecology, biogeography and related fields.</p>
  <h2>Commitments to Lab Members</h2>
  <p>My aim is to develop every lab member into a skilled and independent researcher. This includes gaining experience in field and lab work, developing scientific independence in projects, and mastering relevant literature. I also emphasize learning scientific writing, grant writing, presentation skills, networking, and effective communication. I recognize the importance of building resilience to overcome challenges in scientific work.</p>
  <h2>Working Hours</h2>
  <p>Flexible working hours are available, allowing you to adapt your schedule to your natural energy levels. However, biological research may require attention at inconvenient times. Excessive work hours do not necessarily improve scientific outcomes. While I tend to work more than 40 hours due to additional responsibilities, you are not obligated to do the same. Availability between 11am and 3pm, Monday to Friday, is expected unless arranged differently.</p>
  <h2>Email Response Time</h2>
  <p>I may send emails during weekends or odd hours, but please respond during regular working hours unless marked as "URGENT" for immediate attention. Occasionally, I'll share interesting information.</p>
  <h2>Lab Meetings</h2>
  <p>Our lab meetings are Wednesday at 10:00 to 11:50am. During lab meetings, prepare a few minutes introduction/update on your project, including a few bullet points. You can also discuss interesting papers related to your project, even if the data is not publication ready. We encourage the sharing of raw data and logical discussions.</p>
  <h2>Data/Lab Management, Open Science, and Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>We prioritize careful documentation of field, lab, and code in the Daru Lab. Open and FAIR data sharing is promoted for biodiversity science and conservation. We adhere to data licensing, attribution, and acknowledgment practices. Our research papers encourage transparency, and we credit and link back to original data sources. We contribute to biodiversity data standards and create digital tools for data sharing. Our software, computational tools, and analytic code are open source and accessible to ensure reproducibility.</p>
