  <p style="margin-right: 50px;"><p>In June 2023, I received a B.S. in ecology, behavior, and evolution from UC San Diego. There, I worked primarily for Professor Elsa Cleland, researching the demography of the California poppy and how its traits vary across different climates within the state. I also participated in other labs broadly researching plant-pollinator interaction and plant genetics. After graduating from UCSD, I assisted the Green Biome Institute at CSU East Bay by collecting DNA samples of endangered California plant species. Later, I worked as a habitat restoration technician for wetland and grassland ecosystems in the SF Bay Area. In the Daru lab, I am excited to continue investigating how plants adapt to changing environments across both temporal and spatial scales, with the ultimate goal of informing habitat restoration management and conserving biodiversity worldwide.
