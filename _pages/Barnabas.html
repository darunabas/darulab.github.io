  <p style="margin-right: 50px;">Barnabas obtained his undergraduate degree in Zoology at the University of Jos in Nigeria, and a Masters and PhD in Botany at the University of Johannesburg in South Africa. During his studies, he developed an interest in phylogenetics, biogeography, and macroecology of plants across different ecological scales. After completing his PhD, Barnabas was awarded a postdoctoral fellowship at Harvard University, where he focused on new uses of herbarium specimens for ecology and evolutionary biology. Currently, his research focuses on the role of phylogeny in understanding species distribution, conserving unique communities, and how to determine changing distributions in the Anthropocene.</p>
