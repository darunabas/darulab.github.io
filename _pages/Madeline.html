  <p style="margin-right: 50px;">I joined the Daru lab through the BSURP summer program in 2024. I am currently a rising sophomore in the class of 2027 at Stanford University. I am interested in learning about earth systems and environmental systems engineering. I was born and raised in Honolulu, Hawai ªi and love to explore the natural environment, particularly the ocean. I am also learning Mandarin Chinese and hope to become fluent. For my BSURP summer 2024 project, I am researching plant-microbiome responses to climate change over time. My project explores using herbarium records to analyze plant microbes in California poppy and honeysuckle specimens throughout the past few decades.
