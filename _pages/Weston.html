  <p style="margin-right: 50px;"><p>I am a rising junior pursuing a major in Earth Systems and a minor in Computer Science. My research interests surround biodiversity conservation, land use change and fragmentation, understanding ecosystem services, and how computing can enhance our understanding and management of natural systems. Currently, I am working on a project studying shifts in crop wild relatives, their responses to climate change across many factors, and their current distributions in light of protected areas as a part of the BSURP program. In my free time, I enjoy playing basketball, designing native plant gardens, and exploring the ecosystems around me.
