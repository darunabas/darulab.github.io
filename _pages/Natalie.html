  <p style="margin-right: 50px;">Hi, this is Natalie! I’m a sophomore at Stanford University with a prospective major in Cellular, Molecular, and Organismal Biology. I have a broad interest spanning from the microscopic world of cells and molecules to the ecological interactions between species and their environment. I’m particularly fascinated by the sciences of the oceans and the application of rising technologies in scientific navigations. In the summer of 2024, I joined the Daru Lab through the BSURP program, and got to work on this exciting project that explores the temporal turnover of endophytic fungal communities in seagrasses in the past century and the effect of climate change on our valuable coastal ecologies. In my free time, I enjoy making art and going to the beach. My favorite movie is Tokyo Godfathers by Saitoshi Kon.
